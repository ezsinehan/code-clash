## Development Plan

### Phase 1: Core Development

- **Complete Backend Integration**: Fully integrate the backend server to handle all interactions with the Piston API securely. This includes executing code and retrieving results.
- **User Authentication**: Implement user authentication to manage user sessions and track individual progress or submissions.
- **User Interface Enhancements**: Continuously improve the UI/UX of the web editor to support various programming languages, provide syntax highlighting, and display execution results clearly.

### Phase 2: Feature Expansion

- **Matchmaking System**: Develop a matchmaking system to pair users against each other based on skill level or other criteria.
- **Real-Time Interaction**: Implement real-time code sharing and competition features using WebSockets or similar technologies. This could include live code edits, seeing opponent's code in real-time, or timed challenges.
- **Problem Set Expansion**: Regularly update and expand the database of coding problems, possibly allowing community contributions under a review system.

### Phase 3: Security Enhancements

- **Secure Code Execution**: Ensure that the code execution environment is secure and isolated, preventing malicious code from affecting the server or accessing unauthorized resources.
- **Input Sanitization**: Implement rigorous input validation and sanitization on both the client and server sides to prevent injection attacks and other common security vulnerabilities.
- **Rate Limiting and Abuse Prevention**: Introduce rate limiting, CAPTCHA, and other abuse prevention mechanisms to protect the system from being overwhelmed by automated requests or malicious usage.

### Phase 4: Scalability and Performance Optimization

- **Load Testing and Optimization**: Conduct thorough load testing to identify performance bottlenecks and optimize both frontend and backend components.
- **Scalable Infrastructure**: Transition to a scalable cloud infrastructure that can dynamically adjust to load changes, possibly using services like AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud.
- **Caching and State Management**: Implement caching strategies and state management to reduce load times and improve user experience.
- **External Hosting for Piston**: Choose a cloud provider and set up Piston on virtual machines or containers to ensure scalability and reliability. Implement load balancers, auto-scaling, and monitoring to efficiently manage the workload.

### Phase 5: Community and Ecosystem

- **Community Engagement**: Develop features that allow community interaction, such as forums, user profiles, leaderboards, and user-generated content.
- **APIs for Extension**: Provide APIs that can be used by third parties to extend the platform or integrate it with other tools and services.
- **Educational Tools**: Integrate educational tools and resources, providing users with tutorials, tips, and feedback on their code to help them learn and improve.

### Phase 6: Continuous Monitoring and Improvement

- **Feedback Loop**: Establish a continuous feedback loop with users to gather insights and improve features based on user needs and preferences.
- **Automated Testing and CI/CD**: Set up automated testing frameworks and continuous integration/continuous deployment pipelines to ensure reliable and frequent updates to the platform.
- **Accessibility Enhancements**: Ensure that the platform is accessible to all users, including those with disabilities.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
